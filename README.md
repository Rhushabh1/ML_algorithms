# Sentdex_machine_learning

This is from my SoS summer project 2019 on machine learning and deep learning with neural networks.

This repository contains codes that i have learnt from Sentdex tutorials. 
It demonstrates the use of machine learning libraries and how to write a machine learning and neural networks code from scratch.
It has some data files too that i used to train my classifiers as well as neural networks.

Hope that you find it useful.

Cheerio...
